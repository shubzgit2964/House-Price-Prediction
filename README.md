# House-Price-Prediction
House price prediction using Linear Regression is a widely used technique in real estate that helps estimate property values based on key factors. This method analyzes the relationship between a house's price and various independent features such as location, size (square footage), number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property age, and amenities like schools, hospitals, and shopping centers. Linear Regression works by identifying patterns in historical data and understanding how these features influence pricing trends. Once trained on past house sales, the model can predict the price of new properties by assessing their characteristics. One of the biggest advantages of using Linear Regression for house price prediction is its simplicity and interpretabilityâ€”it allows real estate professionals, investors, and homebuyers to understand the impact of different factors on pricing. Additionally, it helps in market analysis, investment planning, and fair property valuation, making it a crucial tool in the real estate industry. However, it has some limitations, such as its assumption of a linear relationship between price and features, which may not always hold in complex housing markets. Despite this, it remains a fundamental and effective approach for price estimation, especially when combined with other advanced techniques.
